According to the World Health Organization, ``285 million people are estimated
to be visually impaired worldwide''~\cite{WHO}.
As part of the Visual Cortex on Silicon program, we have been
developing interfaces, algorithms and hardware platforms to assist the
visually impaired with a focus on grocery shopping. This article describes
the various features that we have incorporated 
into this visual-assist system so that it can be used in multiple contexts.
