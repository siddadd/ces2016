According to the World Health Organization, ``285 million people are estimated
to be visually impaired worldwide''~\cite{WHO}.
Several technologies such as automatic text readers, 
Braille note makers, and navigation assist canes have been developed to assist the
visually impaired. 
Concurrent advances in computer vision and hardware
technologies provides opportunities for a visual-assist system that
can be used in multiple contexts.
As part of the Visual Cortex on Silicon program, we have been
developing interfaces, algorithms and hardware platforms to assist the
visually impaired with a focus on grocery shopping. This article describes
the various features that we have incorporated 
into this visual-assist system so that it can be used in multiple contexts.
