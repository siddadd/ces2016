One of the most important aspects of any technology is how a human interacts with it. Having an intuitive, simple, and functional interface can often be the difference between a successful device and one which isn't. This importance on a interface is even more important when trying to help someone with an impairment. Not only does the interface have to be all the things mentioned above, but it also has to be robust for different environments. In the case of assisting a person with visual impairment this means being able to handle cases which people without visual impairment handle without even realizing they do.

For our assistive technology we employ two main modes of providing this feedback and guidance to the user. these modes are auditory feedback and tactile feedback. To provide this feedback to the users we use two main devices.

One of the devices that we use is a pair of smart glasses. The smart glasses have both a camera and a built in headset, along with networking capability. These built in glasses provide to our system a point of view of the person wearing them which is crucial when need to guide someone to a product. because they are worn like normal sunglasses, they aren't intrusive.
