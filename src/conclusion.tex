This work highlighted the efficacy of personal visual assist systems in our day to day activities. 
More specifically, the design and integration of a multi-task grocery assist system for the visually impaired was 
discussed. We also introduced the latest architectures and emerging devices that are being explored to further improve the capabilities of such systems. 
We continue to integrate text recognition to further improve product recognition; enable dynamic recomendations as we test our system in more challenging 
and distributed environments; and provide querying to personalize recommendations as part of a holistic solution for the visually impaired. 
%As technological advances spur growth, more and more consumer products will become available.
