This work highlighted the efficacy of personal visual assist systems in our day to day activities. 
More specifically, the design and integration of a multi-task grocery assist system for the visually impaired was 
discussed. We also introduced the latest architectures and emerging devices that are being explored to further improve the capabilities of such systems. 
%As technological advances spur growth, more and more consumer products will become available.
